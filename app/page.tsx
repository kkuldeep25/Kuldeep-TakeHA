      <div>Operationally, the customer inadvertently raised duplicate cases, resulting in negative feedback from their leadership despite our clarification that the issue lay with the third-party vendor. In response, I, as the duty manager, engaged with the customer directly, despite the unavailability of the assigned engineer due to personal reasons.
While being on a Customer call, In parallel, I coordinated with another engineer to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Leveraging the customer's operational access to their server, we swiftly identified a Linux file permission issue in a directory, directly related to the third-party software. Despite not being responsible for that third party server instance maintenance, we provided technical recommendations, including chmod and chown commands in Linux.
The customer operations team was the server/instance owner and had permission by their leadership to carry out our recommendations (by following their emergency change process).
Implementing our suggestions promptly resolved the issue, earning positive feedback from the customer and reversing the negative CSAT rating. This successful resolution underscored our commitment to customer satisfaction and willingness to collaborate, ultimately restoring trust and confidence in our support services.

During our call, the Customer ascertained and confirmed that their BI applications is getting the new updated data.
