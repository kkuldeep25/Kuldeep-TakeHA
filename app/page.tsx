      <h1>Rank your 5 most favorite Support tasks.</h1>
      <p>Answer - Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use</p>
      
      {/* Example of adding a new line with an empty <div> */}
      <div>Support tickets are goldmines for product improvement! By analyzing these tickets, we can identify recurring issues that impact user experience. This helps the product team:</div>
<div>Fix underlying architecture problems</div>
<div>Move towards scalable designs</div>
<div> This proactive approach minimizes user impact and strengthens the product overall. Support tickets also reveal customer pain points, allowing the product team to: </div>
<div> Focus on product robustness</div>
<div> Align future roadmaps with customer needs</div>
<div> By working together, support and product teams can deliver a superior customer experience, boosting satisfaction and loyalty. </div>
<div> ============================================</div>
<div> Answer - Work with engineering teams during incidents and provide updates to internal and external stakeholders. </div>
<div> Support managers are key communicators during incidents. We collaborate with internal teams to keep everyone informed (customers, partners, leaders) with clear, timely updates. This transparency manages expectations, minimizes impact, and empowers customers to react (like initiating disaster recovery plans). .</div>
<div>Post-resolution, we provide a summary and initial cause analysis. Once the full investigation concludes, we share the final report with customers and explain the post-incident review outcome. This builds trust and ensures everyone learns from the experience, preventing future occurrences.</div>

<div> ===============================================</div>

<div> Answer 3 -  Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers. </div>

<div> Going the extra mile for customers! As a frontline support manager, I believe in advocating for customer needs. While full feature development might fall outside support's scope, we can still be a bridge between customers and product management. Here's how: </div>
<div> Champion Customer Feedback: Share the product feedback from customers to product management team. </div>
<div> Create AHA Tickets: We translate this feedback into detailed AHA tickets (feature request system) outlining specific needs and expectations. </div>
<div> Transparent Communication: We share the AHA ticket with the customer and key internal stakeholders (account executive, customer success, solution architect) to ensure everyone's aligned. </div>
<div> Estimated Timeframes: We strive to provide customers with estimated timeframes for feature availability whenever possible. </div>

<div> ====================================</div>
<div> Answer 4 - Find and recruit teammates for the support team. </div>

<div> Having a good teammate is like having a strong foundation. Hence it's very important to build a strong support team by building a team with good teammates having the right attitude and necessary aptitude. </div>

<div> We should hire the right set of support teammates who are passionate about the role with strong integrity. Being in a Customer support role requires a customer-first attitude. Should have the perseverance and determination to work as a team and accomplish support org's objective. </div>

<div>  Ups and downs are part of any walk of work, one should demonstrate resilience in the face of challenging situations and perseverance to find the solutions and achieve support objectives   </div>

<div> ====================================</div>
<div> Answer 5 Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer. </div>

<div> To tackle business-critical issues, I'd collaborate with 3rd party partners. This means bringing in the right subject matter experts and working together on all aspects of the investigation. Open communication is key, with clear expectations set for stakeholders. I'd manage timelines, ensuring data gathering, diagnostics, and troubleshooting happen efficiently. Progress updates and potential escalations would be provided. Post-resolution, customer satisfaction and a partner review session ensure continuous improvement. </div>

<div> Work with people to figure out if Vercel is suitable for their use case</div>
<div> Acknowledging the significance of pitching Vercel for diverse use cases, I must prioritize support duties. Deep involvement might compromise essential support deliverables. These tasks usually fall under customer success and solutions architecture. To aid, I'll redirect inquiries to suitable teams like solutions architects, customer success, accounts executives, ensuring thorough support while upholding my core support responsibilities. </div>

<div> ========================================</div>

<div>Rank your 5 least favourite Support tasks</div>
<div> Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News and other 3rd party sites</div>
<div> While it would be an honor to represent Vercel in public forums and assist Vercel community users, prioritizing other critical deliverables takes precedence. This task will have a lower priority on my to-do list. However, I am committed to supporting the Vercel community during my spare time once I've completed my primary work 
responsibilities. </div>

<div>Rank your 5 least favorite Support tasks</div>

<div> Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day</div>
<div> Manual responses for 50+ support emails aren't scalable and consume significant time. Support requests should funnel through valid channels like web/app ticketing portals or email-to-ticketing tool webhooks. Although email e.g., help@abc.com, support@abc.com is convenient for customers, workflow automation tools like Zapier are vital. They automate ticket creation and provide auto-responses with case details. </div>

<div> What do you want to learn or do more of at work? </div>


<div> When it comes to learning, I'll thoroughly explore Next.js functionalities and its unique features compared to React.js. Moreover, I'll delve into Vercel's SaaS platform architecture to understand its offerings better and ensure I'm well-prepared to support Next.js applications on the Vercel platform. </div>

<div> To continue with the learning, I would start by immersing myself in the product, services and team dynamics. This approach would help me to learn and build strong relationships with both the people/team and product/technology. </div>

<div>My existing technical background and eagerness to learn will help to quickly grasp the product and processes with a lesser learning curve. This would set the stage for me to start contributing meaningfully. </div>

<div> A deep understanding of the product empowers me to see things from the customer's perspective. This lets me identify how they're using it, where they might be facing challenges, and how we can help them maximize product potential to solve their problems. </div>

<div> In tandem with mastering the technical aspects, I'll also delve into the customer support operations side. Here's my plan</div>

<div> I'll map the existing data landscape utilized by the support team. Leveraging these data points for analysis will provide valuable insights to enhance customer support. This will help me to quickly start taking Data driven decisions. </div>

<div> By leveraging data and team experience, I'll develop a data-driven action plan to address key areas for improvement. This plan will focus on: </div>
<div> Identifying opportunities to streamline workflows, reduce redundancies, and enhance technical capabilities within the support team. </div>
<div>Analyzing data to pinpoint areas that need improvements. </div>
<div>To minimize Internal Dependencies I would start assessing reliance on other teams and exploring options for greater self-sufficiency within the support team, potentially through knowledge-sharing or cross-training initiatives. </div>
<div>Evaluating processes for automation opportunities to reduce manual tasks and expedite turnaround times. </div>
<div>Identifying common customer issues that could be addressed through improved self-service resources e.g., knowledge base articles, FAQs, troubleshooting guides. </div>
<div>Identifying and addressing any gaps in existing documentation to ensure clarity, completeness, and accessibility for both customers and support staff. </div>
